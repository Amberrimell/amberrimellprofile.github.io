Above is a link & a screenshot of my ideal job; Senior Gameplay Programmer.

-**A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.**

As a Senior Gameplay Programmer, I’m assuming there will be some serious coding, and challenges involved. Being a senior programmer would mean you are very experienced and relied on, possibly even a mentor to others, which I would love. It is an important role to fill. 

Ubisoft is one of my favourite brands, and as unlikely as it is that I will ever actually get to work for them, there's no harm in striving. I’d be happy working for any gaming company or even in other sectors, but Ubisoft is my ultimate dream.

-**A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.**

This position calls for 5+ years’ experience in game development with both online and offline projects, and either a Bachelor’s degree or the equivalent, relative experience in the industry. It requires well-established analytical, synthesis, C & C++ skills. It needs great knowledge of basic algorithms and how to use them based on the projects’ needs. 

The applicant needs to be adaptable to change and have a strong ability to problem solve. Relevant experience in the design & implementation of various game systems, including user interface, game object management, animation, gameplay scripting & online networking is required. As well as, great written & oral skills, and the ability to collaborate.

-**A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.**

Currently, I would say that I am very adaptable and quick to learn. I am undertaking a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology which will prove very useful. I think I am a good problem solver, and I have great oral and text communication skills. I can collaborate with others. I am dedicated and determined and I think that will prove beneficial in my endeavours.  

-**A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can.**

I plan to finish this Bachelor’s degree and immediately find employment in the realm of IT. I’m not sure what exactly I will be qualified to do at the end of the degree but I look forward to entering the industry, and finding out exactly what it is I need to do to further work towards my dream job. I imagine I will have to do some more specialised study in designing/programming.
