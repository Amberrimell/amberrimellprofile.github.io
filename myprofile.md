Hello, and welcome to my My Profile Webpage. My name is Amber, and I am currently undertaking a Bachelor of IT part-time. I have a 1.5 year old, which is proving a challenge to juggle along with studying. I am a Kiwi, though I've been in Australia since I was 10. I write left-handed, but do everything else as a righty would. I like baking, and video games.

I have a love for computers, Playstations and all things tech, though not much experience. This is my very first time using Github, and I have to say it has been a bit confusing so far. Alas, here we are, and I _think_ I have figured it out. So, let's get into it.

**Interest In IT**

-**What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).**

My interest in IT has largely stemmed from gaming. I started playing video games when I was very young, in the early 2000s. I played everything from Pacman and Galaga to the Sims or Mortal Kombat. I was obsessed with games through my teen years. To this day it is how I like to spend my free time, & a lot of my friendships revolve around this.

I think, because I grew up using computers and new devices as they came out, I developed a gift for understanding and fixing them. Family and friends have turned to me with their tech problems for as long as I can remember, and I’ve always enjoyed the challenge of troubleshooting them.

-**Why did you choose to come to RMIT?**

I chose RMIT because I needed the flexibility RMIT offers of online learning while completing the degree. RMIT was the best option for me.

-**What do you expect to learn during your studies?**

I expect to learn all the basics, and some specialized knowledge of everything IT. I don’t know exactly what I will learn, as I don’t know it exists yet, but I’m very excited to find out. I hope to learn all things code, and to have a deeper understanding of what all the different roles in the IT field are, so that I can better work towards what I want to do; video game programming. I would also love to learn more about robotics, AI, cyber security, and graphics.
