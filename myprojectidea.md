# My Project

**Overview**

My project is going to be a video game, built using C# and Unity. This is subject to change as I learn more about the different software available to me and as I form my own preferences as the course goes on. The game will be a 3rd person shooter style game, though the player won’t necessarily have a gun. It’s intended platform will be the PC, but this is also subject to change. The game will be heavily based on females of various ethnicities as heroes and villains, as I feel this is still lacking in the gaming and entertainment industries. 

**Motivation**

Though it has improved in recent years, there still seems to be a real lack of female fronted games. There also isn’t much diversity, the current trend seems to be ‘add 1 or 2 people of colour and everyone will be happy’, but that doesn’t sit right with me. My game will have more people of other ethnicities & races than it will Caucasians. I intend to create a very female-dominated game, with a female protagonist and several female villains. This is not intended as a political statement, I just simply enjoy seeing and playing female characters and think there should be more in the mix.

**Description**

The game will have a female protagonist, whose name, appearance and special items will depend on which class the player chooses, making her way through a new world trying to find her way home. She will make friends of varying races/species along the way and leave them behind as she ventures on to the next world, closer to home. She may have a map or a book or a globe etc, depending on which class the player chooses. The story will constantly vary depending on the player’s choices.

It will be customisable, allowing the player to choose their main fighting style/weapon and branch off of that as they level up. So, the player can choose to be a marksman with a bow or gun, or a fighter with a sword or axe, or a mage etc. The class the player chooses determines their home world and backstory. You will also be able to customise your outfit and hair etc. The playable character’s name will be set based on the class the player chooses.

There will be several boss battles throughout the game. I have a few ideas in mind of different bosses the player will face, including one who is Hydra inspired, a dark angel, and a fire witch. Each boss will be relative to the world that the player has found themselves in.  I’m thinking of creating 12 worlds with 12 bosses, or 13, it’s still up in the air, perhaps it should just be 6 worlds to start off with.

I intend to create a fairy tale world that quickly turns not-so-cute, a demon-ridden waste land, and many other worlds. Each world will of course have different enemies to face at different times, and will be fully open and explorable, with side missions and treasures to be found along the way. 

There will be lots of brooding music, and during combat, heavy metal music will play. The music will all be suited to the environment and enemies the player is facing. I will probably have to create the music myself which I can do using computer programs.
It sounds like a lot, but it will be a rather simple game to start off with, especially graphics wise. I intend to enhance the game as my own skills improve and eventually make it into a high-quality game. It will grow with me and be ever-evolving. 

**Tools and Technologies**

I am not 100% sure of which software, or hardware etc I will need to use to create such a game. I am a total beginner. I do know that a lot of amateur creators use Linux, Unity & C#, and my ‘Ideal Job’ calls for C & C++, so I assume these are all great tools for creating games. The drawbacks are that I have to completely start from scratch, as someone who has never even seen these programs before.

**Skills Required**

I am assuming that by the end of this Bachelor’s degree of Information Technology, I will at least be able to create a basic version of the game I am doing this project on. I think it is definitely feasible for me to create this, given I have the money for the resources needed, such as paid software. My PC should suffice, but I will re-evaluate as the time comes.  I am very determined and passionate about creating games, so I will teach myself outside of this degree if necessary and pursue any further education that is needed.

**Outcome**

The outcome will be an amazing, new, female-dominated game in the arena. I think it would be a hit having such an intense game with such a diverse range of characters. I should at least be able to create a very basic version of this, and hopefully one day I can bring my whole vision to life with amazing graphics.
