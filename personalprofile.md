Personal Profile

As requested, please see below;

-**The results of an online Myers-Briggs test.**

According to the 16 Personalities test, I am a Defender (ISFJ-A). I read through the results and found them to be quite accurate.

-**The results of an online learning style test.**

The “What’s Your Learning Style?” Test has shown that I am a Visual learner. I have always been a visual learner, I picture words and images in my head, and repeat them either internally, or out loud to ensure that they stick in my memory. I also like to type or write things out to make sure that I’m really taking all the information in.

-**The results of one further online test of your choosing.**

The DISC Personality test states that I am, in order of most to least, Steady, Compliant, Influential, Dominant. It states that “You are determined to achieve objectives. You are a clear thinker. You have an inner need to be objective and analytical. You like to pursue a definite course of action. You respond to logic rather than emotion. You are likely to be particularly good at handling challenging technical assignments.” I very much agree with these statements.

-**What do the results of these tests mean for you?**

These tests have confirmed what I already knew, or suspected about myself. It was very interesting to see the results and how accurate they were.

-**How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?**

I think that in a team all of these results show that I am very supportive and inclusive. I like to play supportive roles in all areas of life, and work.

-**How should you take this into account when forming a team?**

I think that I am much more suited for the backline in a team environment, supporting the team from behind the scenes opposed to being in the spotlight.
