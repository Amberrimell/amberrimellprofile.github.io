# Personal Profile

**The results of an online Myers-Briggs test.**

According to the 16 Personalities test, I am a Defender (ISFJ-A). (16 Personalities website). I read through the results and found them to be quite accurate.

**The results of an online learning style test.**

The “What’s Your Learning Style?” Test has shown that I am a Visual learner. (Education Planner website). I agree that I have always been a visual learner. I picture words and images in my head, and repeat them, either internally or out loud, to make sure they stick in my memory. I also like to type or write things out to make sure I’m really taking all the information in.

**The results of one further online test of your choosing.**

The DISC Personality test results state that I am, in order of most to least, Steady, Compliant, Influential, Dominant. They say that ‘You are determined to achieve objectives. You are a clear thinker. You like to pursue a definite course of action. You respond to logic rather than emotion.’ (DISC Personality test results page, para. 6). I very much agree with these statements.


**What do the results of these tests mean for you?**

These tests have confirmed what I already knew, or suspected about myself. It was very interesting to see the results and how accurate they were.

**How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?**

I think that in a team all of these results show that I am very supportive and inclusive. I like to play supportive roles in all areas of life, and work.

**How should you take this into account when forming a team?**

I think that I am much more suited for the backline in a team environment, supporting the team from behind the scenes opposed to being in the spotlight.
